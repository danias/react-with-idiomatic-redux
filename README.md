# React with Idiomatic Redux

This is the final product of a great Redux tutorial by Dan Abramov on Egghead.io. You can see a working copy on surge.sh as [idiomatic-redux](http://idiomatic-redux.surge.sh/). The repository includes both [part 1](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux) and [part 2](https://egghead.io/courses/building-react-applications-with-idiomatic-redux). If you follow the tutorial and watch the videos, do not skip part 1.

The major difference between this repository and Dan Abramov's code has to do with React Router. There have been some major changes in React Router from v3 to v4 and the code has been updated for React Router 4.2.0.

Also there are some minor differences and fixes for old usage of some libraries such as react-logger, node-uuid (deprecated and replaced by uuid) and normalizr.

All the other differences are optional.

## Installation

Initial code is based on create-react-app, so you can simply run:

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

All the other actions you can use create-react-app instructions of course.
